# Webfishing-Ban-List
Help build a safer Webfishing community! 
A list of potentially harmful SteamIDs to use with [Webfishing Cove](https://github.com/DrMeepso/WebFishingCove) dedicated server ban lists and/or protection mods such as [LobbyLifeguard](https://thunderstore.io/c/webfishing/p/Vildravn/LobbyLifeguard/).

## NOTE
Modding (in ways that don't affect others), griefing (boxing glove), and inapproiate use of text chat are NOT valid reasons to be added to this list.
Those types of offenses should be considered on a server-by-server basis or prevented by using the block function.
